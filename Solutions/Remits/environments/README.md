# Environment Configuration Files

These files set up variables that can be used by other scripts in the repo. The majority of these variables are environment specific (dev, qa, prod), so a configuration file is created for each environment to align with this. All files should be present on each of the long-lived branches of the repo, and any updates must be promoted accordingly to avoid merge conflicts and unexpected behavior.
