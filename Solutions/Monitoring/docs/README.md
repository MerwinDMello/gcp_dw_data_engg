# Code Owners for this Repo
Separate individuals and/or teams can be set up as code owners for the repo. Branch rules can then be set up to require approval from a code owner prior to pull requests being merged into the the associated long-lived branch. It is also possible to set more granular rules such that specific individuals/teams are required to review code that is stored in certain folders or of a certain file type. [Reference GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) to learn more about code owners and the CODEOWNERS file syntax.
