A collection of utilities individually developed by each of us to improve our personal workflows.

If you have never written a README.md, its just like writing a recipe. Start with any pro tips, and then go step by step.

**How To Use Files From This Repo**

1. Clone the repo to your documents folder. 
    - If you already have this cloned but want the most up to date version of the repo, CD to the repo in your local and then run the following. (without the bullet)
        - git pull
2. Open the README.md associated with the scripts that you want to run. 
3. Learn how to configure the script to run for you. 
4. Run the script. 
    - Contact the dev in charge of those scripts if you have any issues and see if you can set up a knowledge transfer. Use that time to further document the script and it's functionality.

**How To Add Projects/Scripts To This Repo**

1. Clone the repo to your documents folder.
    - If you have cloned the repo already, make sure to GIT PULL to get the current state of the repo before you update it with your documents. 
2. Create a folder that holds your scripts, and a README.md file outlining the functions and intentions of your script's application. 
3. Add that folder to your repo, along with the files and README.md inside of it. 
4. Now we will open the command prompt, and CD to the repo on your local. Then run the following steps individually
    - git add . 
        - (make sure to include the ".", this means all changes)

    - OPTIONAL 
        - git status (this will show you changes youve made to the repo against it's current state)
    - git commit -m "insert a message about your changes here. It can be short"
    - git push

5. Now your changes or project have been uploaded for others to use!
